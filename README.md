## This is the official implementation code of [STPrivacy](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Li_STPrivacy_Spatio-Temporal_Privacy-Preserving_Action_Recognition_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf).
### 1. In response to the massive email requests of the code, we clean and release the core implementation parts, i.e., the token sparsification in training and testing mode, the action and privacy recognizer. 
### 2. The complete training code will not be released recently because we are considering a commercial scenario of the proposed method.
### 3. The annotations collected in this paper are also provided.
